                The name Google was created accidentally, it was originally supposed to be named ‘Googol’. (Googol is the digit 1 followed by 100 zeroes).
                The founders checked to see if that domain name was taken, but accidentally searched for ‘google.com’ instead of ‘googol.com’. They liked that name even better and registered the domain name on September 15, 1997.
